# Longest Consecutive Sequence 

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

## 🔍 Examples

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]`
- **Output:** `4`
- **Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]`
- **Output:** `9`


## 📝 Constraints
- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.
