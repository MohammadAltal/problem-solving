# Palindrome Number 

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a **palindrome**, and `false` otherwise.

Palindrome: An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same forward and backward.
For example, `121` is a palindrome while `123` is not.



## 🔍 Examples

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `x = 121`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.


### Example 2:
- **Input:** `x = -121`
- **Output:** `false`
- **Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


### Example 3:
- **Input:** `x = 10`
- **Output:** `false`
- **Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## 📝 Constraints
- `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`
