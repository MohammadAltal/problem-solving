# Isomorphic Strings 

Given two strings `s` and `t`, *determine if they are isomorphic*.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

## üîç Examples

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `s = "egg", t = "add"`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:**  
  The strings `s` and `t` can be made identical by:  
  - Mapping `'e'` to `'a'`. 
  - Mapping `'g'` to `'d'`.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `s = "foo", t = "bar"`
- **Output:** `false`
- **Explanation:** The strings `s` and `t` can not be made identical as `'o'` needs to be mapped to both `'a'` and `'r'`.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** `s = "paper", t = "title"`
- **Output:** `true`

## üìù Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.
