# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock 📈

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`<sup>th</sup> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the **maximum profit** you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## 🔍 Examples

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`
- **Output:** `5`
- **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
  - *Note:* Buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`
- **Output:** `0`
- **Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.


## 📝 Constraints
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`
